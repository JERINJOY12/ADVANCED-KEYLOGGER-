# ADVANCED-KEYLOGGER-
Keyloggers are a serious concern since they secretly record private data. They come in hardware and software forms. Keystroke logging, sometimes called keylogging or keyboard capture, is the process of keeping track of the keystrokes that are made on a keyboard. The goal of this project is to raise awareness of the capabilities of keyloggers and build a software-based keylogger with advanced features that include clipboard information, system information, etc. Programs known as "software-based keyloggers" are installed on a device and are designed to secretly record keystrokes made by the user. The data is then sent through email to a third party or stored in a specific folder without the user's knowledge. Keyloggers can be used for good reasons like parental control and corporate surveillance, but they can also be abused for illicit data capture.

The developed keylogger will collect:

Keystrokes and Clipboard Information:
The keylogger will proficiently capture all keystrokes made by the user, providing insights into their digital interactions. Additionally, it will record clipboard content, including text and files copied by the user, offering a comprehensive understanding of the data being manipulated.

System Information:
Gathering critical system information such as hardware specifications, operating system details, and network configurations is an essential feature. This data can aid in assessing the user's system environment and potential vulnerabilities.

Clipboard Images:
The keylogger will possess the capability to capture and store images copied to the clipboard, providing a visual record of the user's activities and facilitating a more holistic view of their actions.

Screenshots:
Capturing periodic screenshots of the user's screen will further enhance the monitoring capabilities. These screenshots will offer contextual information to complement the captured keystrokes and clipboard data.

After collecting the crucial information, the data will be transmitted to third parties in an encrypted form so that there is no unauthorized access during transmission.
